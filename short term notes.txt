

- separate pulseCHARACTER from pulsePlayer? Player should CONTAIN the character being used I think.
- game end conditions: time, but allow unlimited. leave design room for first-to-X

LOW PRIORITY
- convert to simpler configged inputs BEFORE input serialization
	- no reason to at the moment? How costly is it.
	- is there actually any advantage?
		- yeah cuz rn we need both clients to know each others' input config & apply it after deserialization
			- that's whack.
- small input delay

- matchmaking server w/ rooms
- research: game physics. How to make better-feeling physics objects.
	- ball max speed vs character max speed is quite relevant. Maybe RL boost has it right
	- ball spin, render it in a way where spin is visible
	- ball needs to slow down faster, I think
	- game speed??
- pulse player
	- pulse ability
	- movement
		- diagonal speed cheats
		- anything else?
	- attraction ability
- arenas with curved walls
	- just jack up the border-radius on a hollow rectangle? is that possible?
	- polylines or https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/colliders/#heightfields
	- research: HTML canvas drawing methods for this
- research: how bad is p2p.
	- is it exploitable in any way? Does the host have an advantage?
		- theoretically. But it would be hard to do in a subtle way
		- redux dev config would be a funny backdoor 
	- are there any actual advantages to the server-of-truth approach?
	- how difficult would it be to port to server-of-truth?
	- what is the tech debt of sticking with p2p? methinks not very high?
- research: deal with stalling better
	- game should not stall... at all. ie the clock should just keep ticking while stalled
	- ^ maybe only possible with authoratative server 
- control config menu
	- localStorage??
