- multiplayer hash as myGame param
	- requires some refactoring.
	- would allow joining game differently (via pause menu) 

- pause menu
	- start game in local, online button in menu?

- game end conditions: time, but allow unlimited. leave design room for first-to-X
- matchmaking server w/ rooms

- research: game physics. How to make better-feeling physics objects.
	- ball max speed vs character max speed is quite relevant. Maybe RL boost has it right
	- ball spin, render it in a way where spin is visible
	- ball needs to slow down faster, I think
	- game speed??
- pulse player
	- pulse ability
	- movement
		- diagonal speed cheats
		- anything else?
	- attraction ability

- curved walls
	- just jack up the border-radius on a hollow rectangle? is that possible?
	- polylines or https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/colliders/#heightfields
	- research: HTML canvas drawing methods for this

- cpu players

- think about: character,stage,cpu select
	- COULD I INCORPORATE PHYSICS TWEAKING IN HERE SOMEHOW

- animations:
	- cpu canvas animation. Google it biyatch
	- contacts should probably glow (lighting on walls & objects) & spark (particle effects)
	- screen shake?

- research: deal with stalling better
	- game should not stall... at all. ie the clock should just keep ticking while stalled
	- ^ maybe only possible with authoratative server..
		-BUT what would it even look like to NOT stall on a server?
			- I promised myself it would be an easy p2p->sever port
				- therefore it must be easy to do p2p stall handling assuming host's machine doesn't stall..

LOW PRIORITY
- convert to simpler configged inputs BEFORE input serialization
	- no reason to at the moment? How costly is it.
	- is there actually any advantage?
		- yeah cuz rn we need both clients to know each others' input config & apply it after deserialization
			- that's whack.
- small input delay
	- https://github.com/rameshvarun/netplayjs/issues/27
- research: how bad is p2p.
	- is it exploitable in any way? Does the host have an advantage?
		- theoretically. But it would be hard to do in a subtle way
		- redux dev config would be a funny backdoor 
	- are there any actual advantages to the server-of-truth approach?
	- how difficult would it be to port to server-of-truth?
	- what is the tech debt of sticking with p2p? methinks not very high?
- control config menu
	- localStorage??
