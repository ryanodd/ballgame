- net collision
- store & display game Score
- reset game after goal
	- destroy & re-init scene entirely?
	- or reset positions somehow?
- serialize more than just the world. Should sync Score, player stats (boost) & stuff like that
- convert to simpler configged inputs BEFORE input serialization
- small input delay
	- https://github.com/rameshvarun/netplayjs/issues/27
- separate pulseCHARACTER from pulsePlayer? Player should CONTAIN the character being used I think.
- port to react/redux
	- OR find an easier way to communicate than Vue.set (upgrade to Vue 3 maybe)
- matchmaking server w/ rooms
- research: game physics. How to make better-feeling physics objects.
	- ball max speed vs character max speed is quite relevant. Maybe RL boost has it right
	- ball spin, render it in a way where spin is visible
	- ball needs to slow down more, I think
	- youtube time xd
- pulse player
	- pulse ability
	- movement
		- diagonal speed cheats
		- anything else?
	- attraction ability
- arenas with curved walls
	- just jack up the border-radius on a hollow rectangle? is that possible?
	- polylines or https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/colliders/#heightfields
	- research: HTML canvas drawing methods for this
- research: how bad is p2p.
	- is it exploitable in any way? Does the host have an advantage?
	- are there any actual advantages to the server-of-truth approach?
- research: deal with stalling better
- control config menu
	- localStorage??
