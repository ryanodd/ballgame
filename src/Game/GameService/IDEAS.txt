Pulse
- simple circle, simple movement
- burst outward, briefly increasing circle radius. Pushes ball
- suck inward (creates a magnetic force?)

Double
- control 2 bodies at once
- create rope between?

Bucket
- can "pick up" ball in C-shape body (or should it be a sticky shape?)
- can launch ball
- I get the feeling that its movement should suck, cuz it seems real good
- How do players make it lose the ball?

Shooter
- shoot other players (lowering their resource meter)
- shoot the ball to propel it!
- 1 powerful shot (revolver) or lots of little shots (gatling gun)?

Line
- defensive character
- pong-like shape
- ability to increase width for resource meter?
